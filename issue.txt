First, look at fields in cases. I recently added some customisation to enable users to set max length on text fields.

You'll see that, if you add a string like [L1234] into the Notes/Content/Description of a step, and that step is type "text", then that step will have a fixed maximum length.

So if you use e.g. "Enter full US area code [L6]" as the Notes, the note will be shown, " [L6]" will be stripped out, but the field will have a max length of 6 characters, shown in a note and also enforced in HTML.

See case-show-steps-contents.php and case-show-steps.php and figure out how this works. (You'll need to edit the same files.)

What I would like you to do is to extend this functionality for customising the format of text fields. We'll only deal with regular text field steps for now.

Let's start with something simple, like requiring a field to contain only numbers.

So you should be able to add "[NUM]" to the step's Notes, and that will force the field to be numeric when the step is used in a case. That could be validated with JavaScript perhaps, by adding a class ="validate-number" that gets a check to run when the field is edited.

Another option is to add "[EMAIL]" to a field, which will change the input type from <input type="text"> to <input type="email"> which means we'll use modern browsers' in-built HTML5 validation.
