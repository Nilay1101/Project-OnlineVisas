ISSUE #208 : 

Details:

    1. When a stakeholder is added to a case (petition or lead), and they are not already a user, they will have a "stub" user account created.
    2. That partial account has their name/email, but no password hash. Instead, there's a long random number (tUsers > activation_code).
    3. They'll also get a link for their first login. This gives us the opportunity to give first-time visitors a simpler experience.
    4. The login link is displayed on their Stakeholder panel under the case, Stakeholders tab.
    5. Please try out the process for yourself. Add a stakeholder (random email is fine), and copy the link, paste into a new browser (or incognito window).
    6. New stakeholders will also get a short welcome email (functions.php > stakeholderAdd() function). That email contains their one-time login link.
    7. After they use the login link and set their password, the login code is removed from the database and they'll have to use regular login instead.
    8. This helps us maintain security by letting all users set their own passwords.

Your task:

    1. If you click on a user at various points in the system, it will bring up their user details page.
    2. For part-registered stakeholders, I want the login link to be displayed on their user details page, not only on the stakeholder panel.
    3. Let's say that it can always be displayed to all users, i.e. whoever has privileges to see the page will be able to see the link.
