Come up with a way to assign particular stakeholders automatically on all new cases? (leads or petitions) for a Firm or an Organization.

Right now, we hack it with a function ovAddSpecialStakeholders().

Let's change this... If someone is a Firm or Org admin, when they go to their Firm/Org page, show a new table "Automatic Stakeholder Role" that lists all users who belong to that Firm/Org, with a drop-down for stakeholder role against each one. Also add "Do not add" as the initial setting.

Any user that does have an automatic role set should be added automatically to any new leads or petitions started by that firm or org.
