Online Visas Inc. aims to revolutionize the multi-billion-dollar global immigration law sector in a few years.

Technically, we are automating the process of preparing immigration documentation using a distributed platform that combines 24/7 asynchronous collaboration by stakeholders all over the world with advanced document production of immigration forms, letters, and graphical cover pages.

The move to a distributed, online collaboration platform also enables OnlineVisas to apply an Uber-style model to service provision, essentially building a dominant player almost overnight by linking multiple smaller providers. In just our second year of operation, we already have a network of immigration attorneys with offices in over 15 countries, making the OnlineVisas network among the top five biggest global players.
